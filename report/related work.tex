\todo[inline]{Give some examples of existing hate speech detection methods from literature that for example use traditional Machine Learning algrorithms or Bag of Words}

\section{Cost assessment in hate speech detection}
\todo[inline]{Explain how we could do cost analysis in hate speech detection and why some methods do not work (such as expressing the costs in money or time) and which methods might work (such as using surveys for retrieving subjective costs). Also, explain what Magnitude Estimation is and provide examples of studies that used it to retrieve subjective judgements.}
