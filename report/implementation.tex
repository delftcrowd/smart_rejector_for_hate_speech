\section{System architecture}
\todo[inline]{Explain design of the smart rejector and how the different methods are combined}

\section{Phases}

\subsection{Training}
\todo[inline]{The system will probably support a training and deployment phase. Explain here the training phase of the smart rejector. During this phase, the preparations are done for training the model, determining the optimal rejection threshold, and preparing things for detecting the unknown unknowns}

\subsection{Deployment}
\todo[inline]{Explain how the smart rejector works in the wild and is detecting hate speech in new unlabelled data.}
