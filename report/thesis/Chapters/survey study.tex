\section{Research question and hypothesis}
% "Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of relationships between your variables. 2. For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions. 3. If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. 4. A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions. 5. For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested. 6. If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory"
