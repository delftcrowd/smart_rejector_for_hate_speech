\chapter{Discussion}
\todo[inline]{Answer research questions}
\todo[inline]{The rejection threshold is calculated using the test set. This test set needs to be as realistic as possible.}
\todo[inline]{Hate speech is difficult domain as there tend to be a lot of disagreement between people about what is considered hate speech and what not. Most datasets are binary labeled but perhaps it's better that hate speech datasets use an ordinal scale to define how hateful a text sample is.}
\todo[inline]{Explain difficulties in coming up with numerical cost/gain values of (in)correct predictions and rejections}
\todo[inline]{Discuss future work}

\section{Survey study}

\section{Value-sensitive rejection}

\section{Implications}
\todo[inline]{Explain that \cite{olteanu2017limits} claims that we need more human-centred metrics instead of abstract metrics such as precision and we agree with that by introducing our own human-centred metric}

\section{Limitations}
